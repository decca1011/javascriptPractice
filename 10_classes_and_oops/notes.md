# javascript and classes

<!-- Yes, JavaScript does have classes. Classes were introduced in JavaScript with the release of ECMAScript 6 (ES6) in 2015. They provide a more familiar and convenient syntax for creating objects and handling inheritance, similar to class-based languages like Java or C++. However, it is important to note that JavaScript classes are primarily syntactical sugar over its existing prototype-based inheritance model. -->

## 4 pillars
> Encapsulation: Bundles data and methods, restricting direct access to some components.
>Abstraction: Hides complex implementation details, exposing only necessary parts.
>Inheritance: Allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
>Polymorphism: Enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, allowing for method overriding.
